                        <p>
                            Hi, I'm Lucke and I'm currently a Data Scientist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am very passionate about programming and data. Oh and also football! &#128517
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I believe in data literacy as the main driver of change in the coming years. The more people know how to interpret data, the more empowered they will become.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is my little corner of the internet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             Here I write about some of my projects and studies involving data, programming, machine learning and anything else I find interesting to share.
