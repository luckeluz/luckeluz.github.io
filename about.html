                        <p>
                            Hi, my name is Lucke and I am a Brazilian Chemical Engineer. In the near future, I hope to become a data scientist and I'm working and studying hard for that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered a passion for programming, data and statistics in the late years of my undergrad studies and I've been building my skills to enter the field of Data Science since then.
                        </p>
                        <p style="color:#9C270A; font-weight:bold;">
                            Open to proposals!
                        </p>
