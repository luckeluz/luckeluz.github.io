                        <p>
                            Hi, I'm Lucke and I am a Data Professional.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've done a little bit of everything related to data... from building data pipelines and data warehouses, developing machine learning models, MLOps pipelines and delivering analytics dashboards and visualizations to backend development and deployment of microservices in Kubernetes and AWS.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This is my little corner of the internet.

                        <p>
                             Here I write about some of my projects, experiments and studies involving data, programming or anything else I find interesting to write about.
